## AirBnB Clone
<p>This is the first step towards building the AirBnB clone. It collectively covers the fundamental concepts of higher level programming.</p>
<p>The project involves creating a clone of the <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">Airbnb website</a>, which is an online platform that enables people to book unique accommodations around the world.</p>
<p>The website allows users to search for various types of accommodations, such as apartments, villas, hotels, and hostels, and book them online.</p>
<p>The project is suitable for developers who want to improve their web development skills, especially in front-end development, back-end development, and database management.</p>

## The Console
<p>A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging).</p>
<p>This is the command interpreter for the Airbnb clone website, implementing a back-end system that can interpret user commands and manipulate data without a visual interface.</p>
<p>It is a custom shell or command-line interface (CLI) that allows developers to interact with the website's database directly.<p>
<p>The console should provide a set of commands that developers can use to manipulate data in the database, such as creating new listings, updating existing ones, deleting listings, and querying for information about specific listings<p/>
<p>It is built using the Python3 programming language</p>
