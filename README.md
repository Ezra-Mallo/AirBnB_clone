## AirBnB Clone
<p>This is the first step towards building the AirBnB clone. It collectively covers the fundamental concepts of higher level programming.</p>
<p>The project involves creating a clone of the <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">Airbnb website</a>, which is an online platform that enables people to book unique accommodations around the world.</p>
<p>The website allows users to search for various types of accommodations, such as apartments, villas, hotels, and hostels, and book them online.</p>
<p>The project is suitable for developers who want to improve their web development skills, especially in front-end development, back-end development, and database management.</p>
